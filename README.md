# Discord Multipurpose Bot

A feature-rich Discord bot built with **Discord.js v14**, designed to handle moderation, leveling, calendars, reaction roles, Twitch status updates, and more.  
The bot uses **SQLite (better-sqlite3)** for persistent storage and supports **Google Calendar integration** to asllow organisation accross teams and projects, I amde this to assist in team projects with my college group projects.
This allowed us to easily see who was assigned to each task and see when their work deadline was.
